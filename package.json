  "description": "First and foremost, I built this because I legitimately want to automate my grocery shopping and recipe ideation with a focus on promotional items. It's fun having an ingredient constraint for recipes, but manually sifting through 1500-2000 items per week is tedious. Also manually tracking sale prices both historically and across competing brands to understand whether a sale is actually \"good\" is not an easy undertaking.",
